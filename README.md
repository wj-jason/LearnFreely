# LearnFreely

Based in St. John's NL, LearnFreely is a local not-for-profit organization offering free tutoring to high school students for the majority of high school courses, including all STEM and most AP/IB courses. Our team is composed of university students who aim to develop academic skills by offering a semester-long mentorship. Our philosophy emphasizes long-term academic growth by helping students with their most demanding course and teaching re-applicable study habits that should independently be applied to their other courses and in further post-secondary studies. We are very excited to serve our local community and prepare students for their future academic endeavors.

This repository currently contains small scripts for use by the team, but we soon plan to migrate the webstie off Wordpress so this repository will be used to facilitate development of the site.
